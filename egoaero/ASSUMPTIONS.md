# EgoAERO reproduction — assumptions & deviations

Every value the paper leaves unspecified, with the section it fills and the source.

## Config defaults
- `track.*` weights/thresholds (App A): paper gives no values → defaults borrowed from
  BundleSDF [16] / FoundationPose [17] conventions. (Task 1, 8, 9)
- `contact.opp_gap_m=0.5mm`, `contact.region_weights`, `contact.pen_eps_m=2mm` (App C):
  paper specifies thumb/thenar gaps and bounds only → these are documented defaults. (Task 1, 13-14)
- `hand.depth_bias_m`, `track.drift_sigma_*`: mock-mode injected error magnitudes (not from
  paper) used to exercise the correction/optimizer modules. (Task 5, 8, 11)

## SE3 Parameterization
- `se3_log` / `se3_exp` use a **left-trivialized small-step parameterization** (translation
  decoupled from rotation), adequate for the iterative pose-graph refinement here; full SE3
  exponential not required at the step sizes used. (Task 2, 3, 6)

## Stage 1 (Semantic preprocessing)
- MLLM identity, keyframe count, prompt text, and seed-frame criterion (§2.1.1) are unspecified → mock uses GT masks and
  an `area − occlusion` seed-frame score (`argmax(object_area − hand_overlap)`). (Task 7)
